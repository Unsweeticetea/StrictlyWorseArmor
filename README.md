# StrictlyWorseArmor
Sorts for any strictly worse armor when given a Destiny Item Manager armor export. The script doesn't sort any class items, exotics, or armor with tags so that it doesn't fill with infusion fodder. It does not consider Mobility for non-Hunter armor.

Download Armor_Marker.exe from the latest release.

Steps:
1. Take a .csv export of your DIM armor (Settings, scroll to the bottom, click "Armor" under Inventory Spreadsheets)
2. Place that .csv in the same folder as Armor_Marker.exe
3. Run the Armor_Marker.exe
4. Use the generated DIM filters to find the armor you will be deleting
5. Tag the armor as "junk" or send it to a character for deletion
6. Close the program
