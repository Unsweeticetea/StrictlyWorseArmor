# StrictlyWorseArmor
Sorts for any strictly worse armor when given a Destiny Item Manager armor export. The script doesn't sort any exotics or items with tags so that it doesn't get filled with your infusion fodder.

Have Python installed to run this script.

Steps:
1. Take a .csv export of your DIM armor (Settings, scroll to the bottom, click "Armor" under Inventory Spreadsheets)
2. Place that .csv in the same folder as this .py script
3. Run the script
4. Compare listed item IDs and delete strictly worse armor
5. Close the script

You can filter the IDs in DIM with "Id:XYZ" and mark them for deletion.
